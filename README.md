## üí°Inspiration

My inspiration behind your project is to provide a **comprehensive platform for content creators to grow their online presence and establish trust with their audience**. A one-stop-shop that can offer a range of content creation and management services _to help creators optimize their workflow and maximize their impact_. Additionally, I have noticed a gap in the market for a service that **_combines fast and efficient content delivery_** with **_accuracy and fabulous design_**. By combining all of these elements, I have provided a _unique_, _beautiful_ and _valuable resource_ for content creators looking to take their brand to the next level.

## ‚öô What it does

My idea for MakeSurge is a platform that provides various __content creation, designing and management services__ for businesses or individuals looking to __establish a strong online presence__. The platform offers __**website creation and management services, content research, graphic designing, social media management, video editing, and other resources**__ to help users create high-quality content that resonates with their target audience. The goal is to supercharge the growth of the brand or business by providing __**fast, efficient, and reliable services that deliver accurate content with fabulous design**__. Overall, MakeSurge aims to be a one-stop-shop for all content creation needs, making it easy for users to establish trust with their audience and provide value that ultimately helps them grow their business or brand.

## üîß How we built it

I have created this website using **NextJS**, **Framer Motion** __(for smooth animations)__, **Github** (__for saving my code there which helped me to host my website)__, **GoDaddy** (__to bring it online)__. I have also researched a lot about this business and got a brief idea for this.

## üí™ Challenges we ran into

1. __**Technical challenges**__ : Creating a platform using **NextJS** and **Framer Motion** is not easy and even not when I am a __beginner in it__ and also __solo__. I got many error in __NextJS__ when I was using __**mouse listener**__ in it. I also got many error with animations too in __Framer Motion__ regarding __**heading animation**__.

2. __**Design challenges**__ : Creating __fabulous designs with animations__ that accurately reflect the brand and message, require a lot of creativity and effort.

__**But all this challenges was small in front of my passion to create this website.**__
